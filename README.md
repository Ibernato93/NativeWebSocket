# NativeWebSocket
Implementing an android app with a native websocket in c++.
<br>
In this project, currently only the implementation of a websocket without TLS protocol is available
<br>
The [Websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp) library was used to implement the websocket.
<br>
In case you want to manage JSON messages, you can use the [nlohmann/json]([https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)) library already included in this project.
